        text:"We prefer to identify ourselves as technology volunteers. Because to me, if a person can learn the proper use of technology and shape himself accordingly, that is our greatest achievement as a human being. We always say, Being a good person is more important than being a good student. And to be a good person in today's time, you have to know about the current technology. So we are working as technology volunteers."

        text:"We know and say that the children of today are the future of tomorrow. We fully know that our future depends on technology and artificial intelligence. But in all areas of our Bangladesh, technology is still not getting proper and uninterrupted service. So we want to develop by ourselves, a child depending on technology."

        title:"For our parents",
        text:"We can't tell a child to read until we're reading in front of them, said one head teacher. We never watch TV or use phone in front of children, we can't tell them to focus on studies. Because we know children love imitation. Technology abuse is increasing in our present day mostly because our parents are not able to teach children the proper use of technology. Because the use of technology has become easier in our country in the last few years. That's why we have to be aware of ourselves first. Otherwise destructive culture will destroy our children's children. A researcher said in his study, If we do not reduce the misuse of technology from Bangladesh, our country's talent will be lost within a few years. That's why we have to have proper reliance on technology first. We have to come out of this idea that social media or Facebook means internet. We must have a clear idea, what our children are doing on the Internet. And this is how an ideal technology-based society will develop, this is what we want"
