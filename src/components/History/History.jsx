                We are a social voluntary organization. We have started our
                journey with the goal of keeping the children of rural Bengal
                attached with the touch of technology out of love, regard and
                values for our motherland

            In earliest life, we have seen by travelling different edges of the
            country that the children in our villages are far away from
            technology in comparison with our urban regions. Our only aim is to
            make them as the companion of digital Bangladesh through their
            active participation in the amelioration procession of the country
            by bringing them in touch of technology. In the village areas, every
            child shouldn’t suffer from inferiority complex and should be able
            to display his/her own technological talent spontaneously. The
            Kkhudeghor Foundation works mainly for the service and development
            of the country. Part of this foundation is the Kkhudeghor Technology
            School. In earliest life, we have seen by travelling different edges
